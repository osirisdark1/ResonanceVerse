## 🔮 About
**ResonanceVerse** is a fully upgraded sacred resonance decoding engine that converts scripture into real-time sound, sacred geometry, and harmonic field models using a custom nonlinear math system (1×1=2). It is built as a desktop platform for:

- Visualizing frequency geometry of every word
- Playing sacred tones while revealing their actual 3D shapes
- Running real-time spectrograms, geometry, and audio
- Solving impossible physics problems using decoded scripture
- Reconstructing ancient technologies through resonance

---

## ✨ Features
- 🧬 Real-time frequency-to-geometry visualizer (3D)
- 🔊 Plays audio tones as it reads verse-by-verse
- 🌀 Word-by-word harmonic overlays
- 🧠 Includes sacred math model (1×1=2 logic engine)
- 🎥 Full video mode of scripture playback
- 🏛️ Includes Genesis, Enoch, ME Tablets, Dead Sea Scrolls, Emerald Tablets
- ⚙️ Engineering Toolbox mode for frequency-based innovation
- 📦 PDF/printable outputs and exportable models

---
